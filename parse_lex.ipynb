      "['Lex Fridman: The following is a conversation with Ivanka Trump, businesswoman, real estate developer, and former senior advisor to the president of the United States. I’ve gotten to know Ivanka well over the past two years. We’ve become good friends, hitting it off right away over our mutual love of reading, especially philosophical writings from Marcus Aurelius, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Victor Franco, and so on.', 'Lex Fridman: She is a truly kind, compassionate, and thoughtful human being. In the past, people have attacked her, in my view, to get indirectly at her dad, Donald Trump, as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism. These attacks obscured many projects and efforts, often bipartisan, that she helped get done, and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being. Through all that, she never returned the attacks with anything but kindness and always walked through the fire of it all with grace. For this, and much more, she is an inspiration and I’m honored to be able to call her a friend.', 'Lex Fridman: Oh, and for those living in the United States, happy upcoming 4th of July. It’s both an anniversary of this country’s Declaration of Independence and an anniversary of my immigrating here to the U.S. I’m forever grateful for this amazing country, for this amazing life, for all of you who have given a chance to a silly kid like me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all.', 'Lex Fridman: This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here’s Ivanka Trump.']\n",
      "Section: Architecture\n",
      "['Lex Fridman: You said that ever since you were young, you wanted to be a builder, that you loved the idea of designing beautiful city skylines, especially in New York City. I love the New York City skyline. So, describe the origins of that love of building.', 'Ivanka Trump: I think there’s both an incredible confidence and a total insecurity that comes with youth. So, I remember at 15, I would look out over the city skyline from my bedroom window in New York and imagine where I could contribute and add value, in a way that I look back on and completely laugh at how confident I was. But I’ve known since some of my earliest memories, it’s something I’ve wanted to do. And I think fundamentally, I love art. I love expressions of beauty in so many different forms.', 'Ivanka Trump: With architecture, there’s the tangible, and I think that marriage of function and something that exists beyond yourself is very compelling. I also grew up in a family where my mother was in the real estate business, working alongside my father. My father was in the business. And I saw the joy that it brought to them. So, I think I had these natural positive associations. They used to send me as a little girl, renderings of projects they were about to embark on with notes, asking if I would hurry up and finish school so I could come join them.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, I had these positive associations, but it came from something within myself. I think that as I got older and as I got involved in real estate, I realized that it was so multidisciplinary. You have, of course, the design, but you also have engineering, the brass tacks of construction. There’s time management, there’s project planning. Just the duration of time to complete one of these iconic structures, it’s enormous. You can contribute a decade of your life to one project. So, while you have to think big picture, it means you really have to care deeply about the details because you live with them. So, it allowed me to flex a lot of areas of interest.', 'Lex Fridman: I love that confidence of youth.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s funny because we’re all so insecure, right? In the most basic interactions, but yet, our ambitions are so unbridled in a way that kind of makes you blush as an adult. And I think it’s fun. It’s fun to tap into that energy.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, where everything is possible. I think some of the greatest builders I’ve ever met, kind of always have that little flame of everything is possible, still burning. That is a silly notion from youth, but it’s not so silly. Everybody tells you something is impossible, but if you continue believing that it’s possible and to have that sort of naive notion that you could do it, even if it’s exceptionally difficult, that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects ever done.', 'Ivanka Trump: A hundred percent.', 'Lex Fridman: Going out to space or building a new company where like everybody said, it’s impossible, taking on that gigantic company and disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done, or doing huge building projects where, like you said, so many people are involved in making that happen.', 'Ivanka Trump: We get conditioned out of that feeling.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah.', 'Ivanka Trump: We start to become insecure, and we start to rely on the input or validation of others, and it takes us away from that core drive and ambition. So, it’s fun to reflect on that and also to smile, right? Because whether you can execute or not, time will tell. But yeah, no, that was very much my childhood.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, of course, it’s important to also have the humility of once you get humbled and realize that it’s actually a lot of work to build.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: I still am amazed just looking at big buildings, big bridges, that human beings are able to get together and build those things. That’s one of my favorite things about architecture is just like, wow. It’s a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something epic, much bigger than themselves, and it’s like a statue that represents that and it can be there for a long time.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah. I think, in some ways, you look out at different city skylines and it’s almost like a visual depiction of ambition realized, right?', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s a testament to somebody’s dream. Not somebody, a whole ensemble of people’s dreams and visions and triumphs, and in some cases, failures, if the projects weren’t properly executed. So, you look at these skylines, and it’s a testament to that. I actually heard once architecture described as frozen music. That really resonated with me.', 'Lex Fridman: I love thinking about a city skyline as an ensemble of dreams realized.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah. I remember the first time I went to Dubai and I was watching them dredging out and creating these man-made islands. And I remember somebody once saying to me, they’re an architect, an architect actually who collaborated with us on our tower in Chicago. He said that the only thing that limited what an architect could do in that area was gravity and imagination.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, but gravity is a tricky one to work against, and that’s where civil engineer is one of my favorite things. I used to build bridges in high school for physics classes. You have to build bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative to their own weight. You study how good it is by finding its breaking point. And that was a deep appreciation for me, on a miniature scale of on a large scale, what people are able to do with civil engineering because gravity is a tricky one to fight against.', 'Ivanka Trump: It definitely is. And bridges, I mean, some of the iconic designs in our country are incredible bridges.', 'Lex Fridman: So, if we think of skylines as ensembles of dreams realized, you spent quite a bit of time in New York. What do you love about and what do you think about the New York City skyline? What’s a good picture? We’re looking here at a few. I mean, looking over the water.', 'Ivanka Trump: Well, I think the water’s an unbelievable feature of the New York skyline as you see the island on approach. And oftentimes, you’ll see, like in these images, you’ll see these towers reflecting off of the water’s surface. So, I think there’s something very beautiful and unique about that.', 'Ivanka Trump: When I look at New York, I see this unbelievable sort of tapestry of different types of architecture. So, you have the Gothic form as represented by buildings like the Woolworth Building. Or, you’ll have Art Deco as represented by buildings like 40 Wall Street or the Chrysler Building or Rockefeller Center. And then, you’ll have these unbelievable super modern examples, or modernist examples like Lever House and Seagram’s House. So, you have all of these different styles, and I think to build in New York, you’re really building the best of the best. So, nobody’s giving New York their second-rate work.', 'Ivanka Trump: And especially when a lot of those buildings were built, there was this incredible competition happening between New York and Chicago for kind of dominance of the sky and for who could create the greatest skyline, that sort of race to the sky when skyscrapers were first being built, starting in Chicago and then, New York surpassing that in terms of height, at least, with the Empire State Building.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, I love contextualizing the skylines as well, and thinking back to when different components that are so iconic were added and the context in which they came into being.', 'Lex Fridman: I got to ask you about this. There’s a pretty cool page that I’ve been following on X, Architecture & Tradition, and they celebrate traditional schools of architecture. And you mentioned Gothic, the tapestry. This is in Chicago, the Tribune Tower in Chicago. So, what do you think about that, the old and the new mixed together? Do you like Gothic?', 'Ivanka Trump: I think it’s hard to look at something like the Tribune Tower and not be completely in awe. This is an unbelievable building. Look at those buttresses and you’ve got gargoyles hanging off of it. And this style was reminiscent of the cathedrals of Europe, which was very in vogue in the 1920s here in America. Actually, I mentioned the Woolworth Tower before. The Woolworth Tower was actually referred to as the Cathedral of Commerce, because it also was in that Gothic style.', 'Lex Fridman: Amazing.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, this was built maybe a decade before the Tribune building, but the Tribune building to me is, it’s almost not replicable. It personally really resonates with me because one of the first projects I ever worked on was building Trump Chicago, which was this beautiful, elegant, super modern, all glass skyscraper, right across the way. So, it was right across the river. So, I would look out the windows as it was under construction, or be standing quite literally on rebar of the building, looking out at the Tribune and incredibly inspired. And now, the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river, but also the Tribune building and other buildings on Michigan Avenue.', 'Lex Fridman: Do you like it when the reflective properties of the glass is part of the architecture?', 'Ivanka Trump: I think it depends. They have super-reflective glass that sometimes doesn’t work. It’s distracting. And I think it’s one component of sort of a composition that comes together. I think in this case, the glass on Trump Chicago is very beautiful. It was designed by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, a major architecture firm who actually did the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is, I think, an awe-inspiring example of modern architecture.', 'Ivanka Trump: But glass is tricky. You have to get the shade right. Some glass has a lot of iron in it and gets super green, and that’s a choice. And sometimes you have more blue properties, blue-silver, like you see here, but it’s part of the character.', 'Lex Fridman: How do you know what it’s actually going to look like when it’s done? Is it possible to imagine that? Because it feels like there’s so many variables.', 'Ivanka Trump: I think so. I think if you have a vivid imagination, and if you sit with it, and then if you also go beyond the rendering, right? You have to live with the materials. So, you don’t build a 92-story building glass curtain wall and not deeply examine the actual curtain wall before purchasing it. So, you have to spend a lot of time with the actual materials, not just the beautiful artistic renderings, which can be incredibly misleading.', 'Ivanka Trump: The goal is actually that the end result is much, much more compelling than what the architect or artist rendered. But oftentimes, that’s very much not the case. Sometimes also, you mentioned context, sometimes I’ll see renderings of buildings, I’m like, wait, what about the building right to the left of it that’s blocking 80% of its views of the … Architects, they’ll remove things that are inconvenient. So, you have to be rooted in-', 'Lex Fridman: In reality.', 'Ivanka Trump: In reality. Exactly.', 'Lex Fridman: And I love the notion of living with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of the drawings.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: So, both are probably important, because you have to dream the thing into existence, but you also have to be rooted in what the thing is actually going to look like in the context of everything else.']\n",
      "Section: Modern architecture\n",
      "['Ivanka Trump: A hundred percent.', 'Lex Fridman: One of the underlying principles of the page I just mentioned, and I hear folks mention this a lot, is that modern architecture is kind of boring, that it lacks soul and beauty. And you just spoke with admiration for both modern and for Gothic, for older architecture. So, do you think there’s truth that modern architecture is boring?', 'Ivanka Trump: I’m living in Miami currently, so I see a lot of super uninspired glass boxes on the waterfront, but I think exceptional things shouldn’t be the norm. They’re typically rare. And I think in modern architecture, you find an abundance of amazing examples of super compelling and innovative building designs. I mean, I mentioned the Burj Khalifa. It is awe-inspiring. This is an unbelievably striking example of modern architecture. You look at some older examples, the Sydney Opera House. And so, I think there’s unbelievable … There you go. I mean, that’s like a needle in the sky.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. Reaching out to the stars.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s huge. And in the context of a city where there’s a lot of height. So, it’s unbelievable. But I think one of the things that’s probably exciting me the most about architecture right now is the innovation that’s happening within it. There’s example of robotic fabrication, there’s 3D printing. Your friend and who you introduced me to not too long ago, Neri Oxman, which he’s doing at the intersection of biology and technology and thinking about how to create more sustainable development practices, quite literally trying to create materials that will biodegrade back into the earth.', 'Ivanka Trump: I think there’s something really cool happening now with the rediscovery of ancient building techniques. So, you have self-healing concrete that was used by the Romans. An art and a practice of using volcanic ash and lime that’s now being rediscovered and is more critical than ever as we think about how much of our infrastructure relies on concrete and how much of that is failing on the most basic level. So, I think actually, it’s a really, really exciting time for innovation in architecture. And I think there are some incredible examples of modern design that are really exciting. But generally, I think Roosevelt said that, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” So, it’s hard. You look at the Tribune Building, you look at some of these iconic structures. One of the buildings I’m most proud to have worked on was the historical Old Post Office building in Washington D.C. You look at a building like that and it feels like it has no equal.', 'Lex Fridman: Also, there’s a psychological element where people tend to want to complain about the new and celebrate the old.', 'Ivanka Trump: Always. It’s like the history of time.', 'Lex Fridman: There’s just, people are always skeptical and concerned about change. And it’s true that there’s a lot of stuff that’s new that’s not good, it’s not going to last, it’s not going to stand the test of time, but some things will. And just like in modern art and modern music, there’s going to be artists that stand the test of time and we’ll later look back and celebrate them, “Those were the good times.”', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: When you just step back, what do you love about architecture? Is it the beauty? Is it the function?', 'Ivanka Trump: I’m most emotionally drawn, obviously, to the beauty, but I think as somebody who’s built things, I really believe that the form has to follow the function. There’s nothing uglier than a space that is ill-conceived, that otherwise, it’s decoration. And I think that after that initial reaction to seeing something that’s aesthetically really pleasing to me, when I look at a building or a project, I love thinking about how it’s being used.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, having been able to build so many things in my career and worked on so many incredible projects, I mean, it’s really, really rewarding after the fact, to have somebody come up to you and tell you that they got engaged in the lobby of your building or they got married in the ballroom, and share with you some of those experiences. So, to me, that’s equally as beautiful, the use cases for these unbelievable projects. But I think it’s all of it. I love that you’ve got the construction and you’ve got the design, and you’ve got then the interior design, and you’ve got the financing elements, the marketing elements, and it’s all wrapped up in this one effort. So, to me, it’s exciting to sort of flex in all of those different ways.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. Like you said, it’s dreams realized, hard work realized. I mean, probably on the bridge side is why I love the function. In terms of function being primary, you just think of the millions-', 'Ivanka Trump: Oh my gosh, look at that.', 'Lex Fridman: … bridges-', 'Ivanka Trump: Go down. Look at that.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. This is Devil’s Bridge in Germany.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah. I wouldn’t say it’s the most practical design, but look how beautiful that is.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. So, this is probably … Well, we don’t know. We need to interview some people whether the function holds up, but in terms of beauty, and then, what we’re talking about, using the water for the reflection and the shape that it creates, I mean, there’s an elegance to the shape of a bridge.', 'Ivanka Trump: See, it’s interesting that they call it Devil’s Bridge because to me, this is very ethereal. I think about the ring, the circle, life.', 'Lex Fridman: There’s nothing about this that makes me feel … Maybe they’re just being ironic in the names.', 'Ivanka Trump: Unless that function’s really flawed.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, exactly. Maybe-', 'Ivanka Trump: Nobody’s ever successfully crossed it.', 'Lex Fridman: Could cross the bridge. Yeah. But I mean, to me, there’s just iconic … I love looking at bridges because of the function. It’s the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge. I mean, those are probably my favorites in the United States. Just in a city, to be able to look out and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge, and thinking of all the millions of cars that pass, the busyness, us humans getting together and going to work, building cool stuff. And just the bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it creates. It’s cool.', 'Ivanka Trump: And the connectivity as well.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. The network of roads all come together. So, there, the bridge is the ultimate combination of function and beauty.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah. I remember when I was first learning about bridges, studying the cable stay versus the suspension bridge. And I mean, you actually built many replicas, so I’m sure you’ll have a point of view on this, but they really are so beautiful. And you mentioned the Brooklyn Bridge, but growing up in New York, that was as much a part of the architectural story and tapestry of that skyline as any building that’s seen in it.']\n",
      "Section: Philosophy of design\n",
      "['Lex Fridman: What in general is your philosophy of design and building in architecture?', 'Ivanka Trump: Well, some of the most recent projects I worked on prior to government service were the Old Post Office building and almost simultaneously, Trump Doral in Miami. So, these were both two just massive undertakings, both redevelopments, which in a lot of cases, having worked on ground-up construction redevelopment projects, are in a lot of ways much more complicated because you have existing attributes, but also a lot of limitations you have to work within, especially when you’re repurposing a use. So, the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue was-', 'Lex Fridman: It’s so beautiful.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s unbelievable. So, this was a Romanesque revival building built in the 1890s on America’s Main Street to symbolize American grandeur. And at the time, there were post office being built in this style across the country, but this being really the defining one. Still to this day, the tallest habitable structure in Washington. The tallest structure being the monument. The nation’s only vertical park, which is that clock tower. But you’ve got these thick granite walls, those carved granite turrets, just an unbelievable building. You’ve got this massive atrium that runs through the whole center of it that is topped with glass.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, having the opportunity to spearhead a project like that was so exciting. And actually, it was my first renovation project, so I came to it with a tremendous amount of energy, vigor and humility about how to do it properly. Ensuring I had all the right people. We had countless federal and local government agencies that would oversee every single decision we made. But in advance of even having the opportunity to do it, there was a close to two-year request for proposal, like a process that was put out by the General Services Administration. So, it was this really arduous government procurement process that we were competing against so many different people for the opportunity, which a lot of people said it was a gigantic waste of time. But I looked at that and I think so did a lot of the other bidders and say, “It’s worth trying to put the best vision forward.”', 'Lex Fridman: So, you fell in love with this project? This-', 'Ivanka Trump: I fell in love. Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: So, is there some interesting details about what it takes to do renovation, about some of the challenges or opportunities? Because you want to maintain the beauty of the old and now upgrade the functionality, I guess, and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the building magical in the first place.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, I think the greatest asset was already there, the exterior of the building, which we meticulously restored, and any addition to it had to be done very gently in terms of any signage additions. The interior spaces were completely dilapidated. It had been a post office, then was used for a really rundown food court and government office spaces. It was actually losing $6 million a year when we got the concession to build it and when we won. And became one of, I think, a great example of public-private partnerships working together.', 'Ivanka Trump: But I think the biggest challenge in having such a radical use conversion is just how you lay it out. So, the amount of time … I would get on that Acela twice a week, three times a week, to spend day trips down in Washington. And we would walk every single inch of the building, laying out the floor plans, debating over the configuration of a room. There were almost 300 rooms, and there were almost 300 layouts. So, nothing could be repeated. Whereas, when you’re building from scratch, you have a box and you decide where you want to add potential elements, and you kind of can stack the floor plan all the way up. But when you’re working within a building like this, every single room was different. You see the setbacks. So, the setback then required you to move the plumbing.', 'Ivanka Trump: So, it was really a labor of love. And to do something like this … And that’s why I think renovation … We had it with Doral as well. It was 700 rooms, over 650 acres of property. And so, every single unit was very different and complicated. Not as complicated, in some ways, the scale of it was so massive, but not as complicated as the Old Post Office. But it required a level of precision. And I think in real estate, you have a lot of people who design on plan and a lot of people who are in the business of acquiring and flipping. So, it’s more financial engineering than it is building. And they don’t spend the time sweating these details that make something great and make something functional. And you feel it in the end result. But I mean, blood, sweat, tears, years of my life for those projects, and it was worth it. I enjoyed, almost, I enjoyed almost every minute of it.', 'Lex Fridman: So, to you, it’s not about the flipping, to you, it’s about the art and the function of the thing that you’re creating?', 'Ivanka Trump: A hundred percent.', 'Lex Fridman: What’s design on plan? I’m learning new things today.', 'Ivanka Trump: When proposals are put forth by an architect and really just the plan is accepted without … And in the case of a renovation, if you’re not walking those rooms … The number of times a beautifully laid out room was on a blueprint and then, I’d go to Washington and I’d walk that floor and I’d realize that there was a column that ran right up through the middle of the space where the bed was supposed to be, or the toilet was supposed to be, or the shower. So, there’s a lot of things that are missed when you do something conceptually without rooting it in the actual structure. And that’s why I think even with ground-up construction as well, people who aren’t constantly on their job sites, constantly walking the projects, there’s a lot that’s missed.', 'Lex Fridman: I mean, there’s a wisdom to the idea that we talked about before, live with the materials and walking the construction site, walking the rooms. I mean, that’s what you hear from people like Steve Jobs, like Elon. That’s why you live on the factory floor. That’s why you constantly obsess about the details of the actual, not of the plans, but the physical reality of the product. I mean, the insanity of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive working together on making it perfect, making the iPhone, the early designs, prototypes, making that perfect, what it actually feels like in the hand. You have to be there as close to the metal as possible to truly understand.', 'Ivanka Trump: And you have to love it in order to do that.', 'Lex Fridman: Right. It shouldn’t be about how much it’s going to sell for and all that kind of stuff. You have to love the art.', 'Ivanka Trump: Because for the most part, you can probably get 90, maybe even 95% of the end result, unless something has terribly gone awry, by not caring with that level of almost like maniacal precision. But you’ll notice that 10% for the rest of your life. So, I think that extra effort, that passion, I think that’s what separates good from great.']\n",
      "Section: Lessons from mother\n",
      "['Lex Fridman: If we go back to that young Ivanka, the confidence of youth, and if we could talk about your mom. She had a big influence on you. You told me she was an adventurer.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: Olympic skier and a businesswoman. What did you learn about life from your mother?', 'Ivanka Trump: So much. She passed away two years ago now. And she was a remarkable, remarkable woman. She was a trailblazer in so many different ways, as an athlete and growing up in communist Czechoslovakia, as a fashion mogul, as a real estate executive and builder. Just this all-around trailblazing businesswoman. I also learned from her, aside from that element, how to really enjoy life. I look back and some of my happiest memories of her are in the ocean-', 'Ivanka Trump: … memories of her are in the ocean, just lying on our back, looking up at the sun and just so in the moment or dancing. She loved to dance, so she really taught me a lot about living life to its fullest. And she had so much courage, so much conviction, so much energy, and a complete comfort with who she was.', 'Lex Fridman: What do you think about that? Olympic athlete. The trade-off between ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that, and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy every moment of life. That trade-off. What do you think about that trade-off?', 'Ivanka Trump: I think because she was this unbelievable, formidable athlete and because of the discipline she had as a child, I think it made her value those moments more as an adult. I think she was a great balance of the two that we all hope to find, and she was able to find both incredibly serious and formidable. I remember as a little girl, I used to literally traipse behind her at the Plaza Hotel, which she oversaw and actually was her old post office. It was this unbelievable historic hotel in New York City, and I’d follow her around at construction meetings and on job sites. And there she is, dancing. See? That’s funny that that’s the picture you pull up.', 'Lex Fridman: I’m sorry. The two of you just look great in that picture.', 'Ivanka Trump: That’s great. She had such a joy to her and she was so unabashed in her perspective and her opinions. She made my father look reserved, so whatever she was feeling, she was just very expressive and a lot of fun to be around.', 'Lex Fridman: So she, as you mentioned, grew up during the Prague Spring in 1968, and that had a big impact on human history. My family came from the Soviet Union. And then the story of the 20th century is a lot of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, tried the ideas of communism, and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering. So why do you think the communist ideology failed?', 'Ivanka Trump: I think fundamentally as people, we desire freedom. We want agency. And my mom was like a lot of other people who grew up in similar situations where she didn’t like to talk about it that often, so one of my real regrets is that I didn’t push her harder. But I think back to the conversations we did have, and I try to imagine what it’s like. She was at Charles University in Prague, which was really a focal point of the reforms that were ushered in during the Prague Spring and the liberalization agenda that was happening. The dance halls were opening, the student activists, and she was attending university there right at that same time. So the contrast to this feeling of freedom and progress and liberalization in the spring, and then it so quickly being crushed in the fall of that same year when the Warsaw Pact countries and the Soviet Union rolled in to put down and ultimately roll back all those reforms.', 'Ivanka Trump: So for her to have lived through that, she didn’t come to North America until she was 23 or 24, so that was her life. As a young girl, she was on the junior national Ski team for Czechoslovakia. My grandfather used to train her. They used to put the skis on her back and walk up the mountain in Czechoslovakia because there were no ski lifts. She actually made me do that when I was a child just to let me know what her experience had been. If I complained that it was cold out, she’s like, “Well, you didn’t have to walk up the mountain. You’d be plenty warm if you had carried the skis up on your back, up the last run.”', 'Lex Fridman: I feel like they made people tougher back then, like my grandma. And you mentioned, it’s funny, they go through some of the darkest things that a human being can go through and they don’t talk about it, and they have a general positive outlook on life that’s deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be. How bad it could get. My grandma survived Holodomor in Ukraine, which was a mass starvation brought on by the collectivist policies of the Stalin regime, and then she survived the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Never talked about it. Probably went through extremely dark, extremely difficult times, and then just always had a positive outlook on life. And also made me do very difficult physical activity, as you mentioned, just to humble you. Kids these days are soft kind of energy, which I’m deeply, deeply grateful for on all fronts, including just having hardship and including just physical hardship flung at me. I think that’s really important.', 'Ivanka Trump: You wonder how much of who they were was a reaction to their experience. Would she have naturally had that forward-looking, grateful, optimistic orientation or was it a reaction to her childhood? I think about that. I look at this picture of my mom and she was unabashedly herself. She loved flamboyance and glamour, and in some ways I think it probably was a direct reaction to this very austere, controlled childhood. This was one expression of it. I think how she dressed and how she presented, I think her entrepreneurial spirit and love of capitalism and all things American was another manifestation of it and one that I grew up with. I remember the story she used to tell me about when she was 14 and she was going to neighboring countries, and as an athlete, you were given additional freedoms that you wouldn’t otherwise be afforded in these societies under communist rule.', 'Ivanka Trump: So she was able to travel, where most of her friends never would be able to leave Czechoslovakia, and she would come back from all of these trips where she’d do ski races in Austria and elsewhere, and the first thing she had to do was check in at the local police. And she’d sit down, and she had enough wisdom at 14 to know that she couldn’t appear to be lying by not being impressed by what she saw and the fact that you could get an orange in the winter, but she couldn’t be too excited by it that she’d become a flight risk.', 'Lex Fridman: Oh, boy.', 'Ivanka Trump: So give enough details that you are believable, but not so many that you’re not trusted. And imagine that as a 14-year-old, that experience and having to navigate the world that way. And she told me that eventually all those local police officers, they came to love her because one of the things she’d do is smuggle stuff back from these countries and give it to them to give their wives perfume and stockings. So she figured out the system pretty quickly, but it’s a very different experience from what I was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a 14-year-old was dealing with, so I have so much respect and admiration for her.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, hardship clarifies what’s important in life. You and I have talked about Man’s Search for Meaning, that book. Having an ultimate hardship clarifies that finding joy in life is not about the environment, it’s about your outlook on that environment. And there’s beauty to be found in any situation. And also, in that particular situation, when everything is taken from you, the thing you start to think about is the people you love. So in the case of Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl thinking about his wife and how much he loves her, and that love was the flame, the warmth that kept him excited. The fun thing to think about when everything else is gone. So we sometimes forget that with the busyness of life, you get all this fun stuff we’re talking about like building and being a creative force in the world. At the end of the day, what matters is just the other humans in your life, the people you love.', 'Ivanka Trump: A hundred percent.', 'Lex Fridman: It’s the simple stuff.', 'Ivanka Trump: Viktor Frankl, that book and just his philosophy in general is so inspiring to me. But I think so many people, they say they want happiness, but they want conditional happiness. When this and this a thing happens or under these circumstances, then I’ll be happy. And I think what he showed is that we can cultivate these virtues within ourselves regardless of the situation we find ourselves in. And in some ways, I think the meaning of life is the search for meaning in life. It’s the relationships we have and we form. It’s the experience we have. It’s how we deal with the suffering that life inevitably presents to us. And Viktor Frankl does an amazing job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances, and I think it’s just super inspiring to me.', 'Lex Fridman: He also shows that you can get so much from just small joys, like getting a little more soup today than you did yesterday. It’s the little stuff. If you allow yourself to love the little stuff of life, it’s all around you. It’s all there. So you don’t need to have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy, that kind of stuff. It’s all around us. The ability to eat. When I was in the jungle and I got severely dehydrated, because there’s no water, you run out of water real quick. And the joy I felt when I got to drink. I didn’t care about anything else. Speaking of things that matter in life, I would start to fantasize about water, and that was bringing me joy.', 'Ivanka Trump: You can tap into this feeling at any time.', 'Lex Fridman: Exactly. I was just tapping in, just to stay positive.', 'Ivanka Trump: Just go into your bathroom, turn on the sink and watch the water to feel good.', 'Lex Fridman: Oh, for sure. For sure. It’s good to have stuff taken away for a time. That’s why struggle is good, to make you appreciate it. To have a deep gratitude for when you have it. And water and food is a big one, but water is the biggest one. I wouldn’t recommend it necessarily, to get severely dehydrated to appreciate water, but maybe every time you take a sip of water, you can have that kind of gratitude.', 'Ivanka Trump: There’s a prayer in Judaism you’re supposed to say every morning, which is basically thanking God for your body working. It’s something so basic, but it’s when it doesn’t that we’re grateful. So just reminding ourselves every day the basic things of a functional body, of our health, of access to water, which so many millions of people around the world do not have reliably, is very clarifying and super important.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, health is a gift. Water is a gift.', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah.', 'Lex Fridman: Is there a memory with your mom that had a defining effect on your life?', 'Ivanka Trump: I have these vignettes in my mind, seeing her in action in different capacities, a lot of times in the context of things that I would later go on to do myself. So I would go almost every day after school, and I’d go to the Plaza Hotel and I’d follow her around as she’d walk the hallways and just observe her. And she was so impossibly glamorous. She was doing everything in four-and-a-half-inch heels, with this bouffant. It’s almost an inaccessible visual. But I think for me, when I saw her experience the most joy tended to be by the sea, almost always. Not a pool. And I think I get this from her. Pools, they’re fine. I love the ocean. I love saltwater. I love the way it makes me feel, and I think I got that from her. So we would just swim together all the time. And it’s a lot of what I love about Miami actually, being so close to the ocean. I find it to be super cathartic. But a lot of my memories of my mom, seeing her really just in her bliss, is floating around in a body of saltwater.', 'Lex Fridman: Is there also some aspect to her being an example of somebody that could be beautiful and feminine, but at the same time powerful, a successful businesswoman, that showed that it’s possible to do that?', 'Ivanka Trump: Yeah, I think she really was a trailblazer. It’s not uncommon in real estate for there to be multiple generations of people. And so on job sites, it was not unusual for me to run into somebody whose grandfather had worked with my grandfather in Brooklyn or Queens or whose father had worked with my mother. And they’d always tell me these stories about her rolling in and they’d hear the heels first. And a lot of times, the story would be like, “Oh gosh, really? It’s two days after Christmas. We thought we’d get a reprieve.” But she was very exacting. So I had this visual in my mind of her walking on rebar on the balls of her feet in these four-inch heels. I’m assuming she actually carried flats with her, but I don’t know. That’s not the visual I have.', 'Ivanka Trump: I loved the fact that she so embodied femininity and glamour and was so comfortable being tough and ambitious and determined and this unbelievable businesswoman and entrepreneur at a time when she was very much alone, even for me in the development world. And so many of the different businesses that I’ve been in, there really aren’t women outside of sales and of marketing. You don’t see as many women in the development space, in the construction space, even in the architecture and design space, maybe outside of interior design. And she was decades ahead of me, so I love hearing these stories. I love hearing somebody who’s my peer tell me about their grandfather and their father and their experience with one of my parents. It’s amazing.', 'Lex Fridman: And she did it all in four-inch heels.', 'Ivanka Trump: She did it. She used to say, “There’s nothing that I can’t do better in heels.”', 'Lex Fridman: That’s a good line.', 'Ivanka Trump: That would be your exact thing. And when I’d complain about wearing something, and it was the early nineties. Everything was all so uncomfortable, these fabrics and materials, and I would go back and forth between being super girly and a total tomboy. But she’d dress me up in these things and I’d be complaining about it and she’d say, “Ivanka, pain for beauty,” which I happen to totally disagree with because I think there’s nothing worse than being uncomfortable. So I haven’t accepted or internalized all of this wisdom, so to speak, but it was just funny. She had a very specific point of view.', 'Lex Fridman: And full of good lines, pain for beauty.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s funny because just even in fashion, if something’s uncomfortable, to me, there’s nothing that looks worse than when you see somebody tottering around and their heels hurt them, so they’re walking oddly, and they’re not embodying their confidence in that regard. So I’m the opposite. I start with, “Well, I want to be comfortable,” and that helps me be confident and in command.', 'Lex Fridman: A foundation for fashion for you is comfort. And on top of that, you build things that are beautiful.', 'Ivanka Trump: And it’s not comfort like dowdy. There’s that level of comfort, but-', 'Lex Fridman: Functional comfort.', 'Ivanka Trump: … but I think you have to, for me, I want to feel confident. And you don’t feel confident when you’re pulling at a garment or hobbling on heels that don’t fit you properly. And she was never doing those things either, so I don’t know how she was wearing stuff like that. That’s a 40-pound beaded dress, and I know this because I have it and I wore it recently. And I got a work out walking to the elevator. This is a heavy dress. And you know what? It was worth it. It was great.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, she’s making it look easy though.', 'Ivanka Trump: But she makes it look very, very easy.', 'Lex Fridman: Do you miss her?', 'Ivanka Trump: So much. It’s unbelievable how dislocating the loss of a parent is. And her mother lives with me still, my grandmother who helped raise us, so that’s very special. And I can ask her some of the questions that I would’ve… Sorry. I wanted to ask my own mom, but it’s hard.', 'Lex Fridman: It was beautiful to see. I’ve gotten a chance to spend time with your family, to see so many generations together at the table. And there’s so much history there.', 'Ivanka Trump: She’s 97, and until she was around 94, she lived completely on her own. No help, no anything, no support. Now she requires really 24-hour care, and I feel super grateful that I’m able to give her that because that’s what she did for me. It’s amazing for me to have my children be able to grow up and know her stories, know her recipes, Czech dumplings and goulash and [foreign language 00:50:28] and all the other things she used to make me in my childhood. But she was a major force in my life. My mom was working, so my grandmother was the person who was always home every day when I came back from school.', 'Ivanka Trump: And I remember I used to shower and it would almost be comical. I feel like in my memory, and there was no washing machine I’ve seen on the planet that can actually do this, but in my memory, I’d go to shower and I dropped something on the bed and I’d come back into the room after my shower and it was folded, pressed. It was all my grandmother. She was running after me, taking care of me, and so it’s nice to be able to do that for her.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah.', 'Ivanka Trump: I got from her reading, my grandmother. She devoured books. Devoured books. She loved the more sensational ones. So some of these romance novels, I would pick them up, the covers, but she could look at any royal lineage across Europe and tell you all the mistresses.', 'Lex Fridman: All the drama?', 'Ivanka Trump: All the drama. She loved it. But her face was always buried in a book. My grandfather, he was the athlete. He swam professionally or on the national team for Czechoslovakia, and he helped train my mom, as I was saying before, in skiing. So he was a great athlete and she was at home and she would read and cook, and so that’s something I remember a lot from my childhood. And she would always say, “I got reading from her.”', 'Lex Fridman: Speaking of drama, I had my English teacher in high school recommended a book for me by D.H. Lawrence. It’s supposed to be a classic. She’s like, “This is a classic you should read.” It’s called Lady Chatterly’s Lover. And I’ve read a lot of classics, but that one is straight-up a romance novel about a wife who is cheating with a gardener. And I remember reading this. In retrospect, I understand why it’s a classic because it was so scandalous to talk about sex in a book a hundred years ago or whatever.', 'Ivanka Trump: In retrospect, you know why she recommended it to you?', 'Lex Fridman: I don’t know. I think it’s just sending a signal, “Hey, you need to get out more,” or something. I don’t know.', 'Ivanka Trump: Maybe she was seeking to inspire you.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, exactly. Anyway, I love that kind of stuff too, but I love all the classics. And there’s a lot of drama. Human nature, drama is part of it. What about your dad? Growing up, what did you learn about life from your father?']\n",
      "Section: Lessons from father\n",
      "['Ivanka Trump: I think my father’s sense of humor is sometimes underappreciated, so he had an amazing and has an amazing sense of humor. He loved music. I think my mom loved music as well, but my father always used to say that in another life he would’ve been a Broadway musical producer, which is hilarious to think about. But he loves music.', 'Lex Fridman: That is funny to think about.', 'Ivanka Trump: Right? Now he DJs at Mar-a-Lago. So people get a sense of he loves Andrew Lloyd Webber and all of it. Pavarotti, Elton John. These were the same songs on repeat my whole childhood, so I know the playlist.', 'Lex Fridman: Probably Sinatra and all that?', 'Ivanka Trump: Love Sinatra, loves Elvis, a lot of the greats. So I think I got a little bit of my love for music from him, but my mom shared that as well. One of the things in looking back that I think I inherited from my father as well is this interest or understanding of the importance of asking questions, and specifically questions of the right people, and I saw this a lot on job sites. I remember with the old post office building, there was this massive glass-topped atrium, so heating and cooling the structure was a Herculean lift. We had the mechanical engineers provide their thoughts on how we could do it efficiently, and so that the temperature never varied, and it was enormously expensive as an undertaking. I remember one of his first times on the site, because he had really empowered me with this project, and he trusted me to execute and to also rope him in when I needed it.', 'Ivanka Trump: But one of the first time he visits, we’re walking the hallway and we’re talking about how expensive this cooling system would be and heating system would be. And he starts stopping and he’s asking duct workers as we walk what they think of the system that the mechanical engineers designed. First few, fine, not great answers. The third guy goes, “Sir, if you want me to be honest with you, it’s obscenely over-designed. In the circumstance of a 1000-year storm, you will have the exact perfect temperature, if there’s a massive blizzard or if it’s unbearably hot, but 99.9% of the time you’ll never need it. And so I think it’s just an enormous waste of money.” And so he kept asking that guy questions, and we ended up overhauling the design pretty well into the process of the whole system, saving a lot of money, creating a great system that’s super functional.', 'Ivanka Trump: And so I learned a lot, and that’s just one example of countless. That one really sticks out of in my head because I’m like, “Oh my gosh, we’re redesigning the whole system.” We were actively under construction. But I would see him do that on a lot of different issues. He would ask people on the work level what their thoughts were. Ideas, concepts, designs. And there was almost like a Socratic first principles type of way he questioned people, trying to get down to trying to reduce complex things to something really fundamental and simple. So I try to do that myself to the best I can, and I think it’s something I very much learned from him.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, I’ve seen great engineers, great leaders do just that. You see, you want to do that a lot, which is basically ask questions to push simplification. Can we do this simpler? The basic question is, “Why are we doing it this way? Can this be done simpler?” And not taking as an answer that this is how we’ve always done it. It doesn’t matter that’s how we’ve always done it. What is the right way to do it? And usually, the simpler it is, the more correct the way. It has to do with costs, has to do with simplicity of production, manufacture, but usually simple is best.', 'Ivanka Trump: And it’s oftentimes not the architecture or the engineers. It’s in Elon’s case probably the line worker who sees things more clearly. So I think making sure it’s not just that you’re asking good questions, you’re asking the right people those same good questions.', 'Lex Fridman: That’s why a lot of the Elon companies are really flat in terms of organizational design, where anybody on the factory floor can talk directly to Elon. There’s not this managerial class, this hierarchy, where [inaudible 00:58:16] have to travel up and down the hierarchy, which large companies often construct this hierarchy of managers where no one manager, if you ask them the question of what have you done this week, the answer is really hard to come up with. Usually, it’s going to be a bunch of paperwork, so nobody knows what they’re actually do. So when it’s flat, you can actually get as quickly as possible with when problems arise, you can solve those problems as quickly as possible. And also, you have a direct, rapid, iterative process where you’re making things simpler, making them more efficient, and constantly improving.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah. It’s interesting. You see this in government. A lot of people get together, a hierarchy is developed, and sometimes it’s good, but very often just slows things down. And you see great companies, great, great companies, Apple, Google, Meta, they have to fight against that bureaucracy that builds, the slowness that large organizations have. And to still be a big organization and act like a startup is the big challenge.', 'Ivanka Trump: It’s super difficult to deconstruct that as well once it’s in place. It’s circumventing layers and asking questions, probing questions, of people on the ground level is a huge challenge to the authority of the hierarchy. And there’s tremendous amount of resistance to it. So it’s how do you grow something, in the case of a company, in terms of a culture that can scale but doesn’t lose its connection to real and meaningful feedback? It’s not easy.', 'Lex Fridman: I’ve had a lot of conversations with Jim Keller, who’s this legendary engineer and leader, and he has talked about you often have to be a little bit of an asshole in the room. Not in a mean way, but it is uncomfortable. A lot of these questions, they’re uncomfortable. They break the general politeness and civility that people have in communication. When you get a meeting, nobody wants to be like, “Can we do it way different?” Everyone wants to just like, “This lunch is coming up, I have this trip planned on the weekend with the family.” Everyone just wants comfort. When humans get together, they gravitate towards comfort. Nobody wants that one person that comes in and says, “Hey, can we do this way better and way different, and everything we’ve gotten comfortable with, throw it out?”', 'Ivanka Trump: Not only do they not want that, but the one person who comes in and does that puts a massive target on their back and is ultimately seen as a threat. Nobody really gets fired for maintaining the status quo, even if things go poorly. It’s the way it was always done.', 'Lex Fridman: Yeah, humans are fascinating. But in order to actually do great big projects, to reach for the stars, you have to have those people. You have to constantly disrupt and have those uncomfortable conversations.', 'Ivanka Trump: And really have that first principles type of orientation, especially in those large bureaucratic contexts.']\n",
      "Section: Fashion\n",
      "['Lex Fridman: So amongst many other things, you created a fashion brand. What was that about? What was the origin of that?', 'Ivanka Trump: I always loved fashion as a form of self-expression, as a means to communicate either a truth or an illusion, depending on what kind of mood you were in. But this second body, if you-', 'Ivanka Trump: … kind of mood you were in, but this sort of second body, if you will. So I loved fashion and look, I mean my mother was a big part of the reason I did, but I never thought I would go into fashion. In fact, I was graduating from Warden, it was the day of my graduation and Winter calls me up and offered me a job at Vogue, which is a dream in so many ways, but I was so focused. I wanted to go into real estate and I wanted to build buildings, and I told her that. So I really thought that that was going to be the path I was taking and then very organically fashion, it was part of my life, but it came into my life in a more professional capacity by talking with my first of many different partners that I had in the fashion space about…', 'Ivanka Trump: He actually had showed me a building to buy. His family had some real estate holdings and I passed on the real estate deal. But we forged a friendship and we started talking about how in the space that he was in, fine jewelry, there was this lack of product and brands that were positioned for self-purchasing females. So everything was about the man buying the Christmas gift, the man buying the engagement ring. The stores felt like that they were all tailored towards the male aesthetic. The marketing felt like that. And what about the woman who had a salary and was really excited to buy herself a great pair of earrings or had just received a great bonus and was going to use it to treat herself? So we thought there was a void in the marketplace, and that was the first category. I launched Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, and we just caught lightning in a bottle.', 'Ivanka Trump: It was really quickly after that I met my partner who had founded Nine West Shoes, really capable partner, and we launched a shoe collection which took off and did enormously well and then a clothing collection and handbags and sunglasses and fragrance. So we caught a moment and we found a positioning for the self-purchasing multidimensional woman. And we made dressing for work aspirational. At the time, we launched if you wanted to buy something for an office context, the brands that existed were the opposite of exciting. Nobody was taking pictures of what they were wearing to work and posting it online with some of these classic legacy brands. Really, it felt very much like it was designed by a team of men for what a woman would want to wear to the office. So we started creating this clothing that was feminine, that was beautiful, that was versatile, that would take a woman from the boardroom to an after-school soccer game to a date night with a boyfriend, to a walk in the park with their husband.', 'Ivanka Trump: All the different ways women live their lives and creating a wardrobe for that woman who works at every aspect of their life, not just sort of the siloed professional part. And it was really compelling. We started creating great brand content and we had incredible contributors like Adam Grant who was blogging for us at the time and creating aspirational content for working women. It was actually kind of a funny story, but I now had probably close to 11 different product categories and we were growing like wildfire and I started to think about what would be a compelling way to create interesting content for the people who were buying these different categories. And we came up with a website called Women Who Work, and I went to a marketing agency, one of the fancy firms in New York, and I said, “We want to create a brand campaign around this multidimensional woman who works and what do you think? Can you help us?” And they come back and they say, “You know what? We don’t like the word work. We think it should be women who do.”', 'Ivanka Trump: And I just start laughing because I’m like women who do. And the fact that they couldn’t conceive of it being sort of exciting and aspirational and interesting to sort of lean into working at all aspects of our lives was just fascinating to me, but showed that that was part of the problem. And I think that’s why ultimately, I mean when the business grew to be hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, we were distributed at all the best retailers across the country from Neiman Marcus, to Saks to Bloomingdale’s and beyond. And I think it really resonated with people in an amazing way and probably not dissimilar to how I have this incredible experience every time somebody comes up to me and tells me that they were married in a space that I had painstakingly designed, I have that experience now with my fashion company. The number of women who will come up tell me that they loved my shoes or they loved the handbags, and I’ve had women show me their engagement rings. They got engaged with us and it’s really rewarding. It’s really beautiful.', 'Lex Fridman: When I was hanging out with you in Miami, the number of women that came up to you saying they love the clothing, they love the shoes is awesome.', 'Ivanka Trump: All these years later.', 'Lex Fridman: All these years later. What does it take to make a shoe where somebody would come up to you years later and just be just full of love for this thing you’ve created? What’s that mean? What does it take to do that?', 'Ivanka Trump: Well, I still wear the shoes.', 'Lex Fridman: I mean, that’s a good starting point, right? Is to create a thing that you want to wear.', 'Ivanka Trump: I feel like the product… I think first and foremost, you have to have the right partner. So building a shoe, if you talk to a great shoe designer, it’s like it’s architecture. Making a heel that’s four inches that feels good to walk in for eight hours a day, that is an engineering feat. And so I found great partners in everything that I did. My shoe partner had founded Nine West, so he really knew what went into making a shoe wearable and comfortable. And then you overlay that with great design and we also created this really comfortable, beautifully designed, super feminine product offering that was also affordably priced. So I think it was the trifecta of those three things that I think it made it stand out for so many people.', 'Lex Fridman: I don’t know if it’s possible to articulate, but can you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing, what you go through to bring an idea to life?', 'Ivanka Trump: So not being a designer, and this was true in real estate as well, I was never the architect, so I didn’t necessarily have the pen. And in fashion, the same way. I was kind of like a conductor. I knew what I liked and didn’t like, and I think that’s really important and that became honed for me over time. So I would have to sit a lot longer with something earlier on than later when I had more refined my aesthetic point of view. And so I think first of all, you have to have a pretty strong sense of what resonates with you. And then in the case of my fashion business, as it grew and became quite a large business and I had so many different categories, everything had to work together. So I had individual partners for each category, but if we were selling at Neiman Marcus, we couldn’t have a pair of shoes that didn’t relate to a dress, that didn’t relate to a pair of sunglasses and handbags all on the same floor.', 'Ivanka Trump: So in the beginning, it was much more collaborative. As time passed, I really sort of took the point on deciding, this is the aesthetic for the season, these are the colors we’re going to use, these are fabrics, and then working with our partners on the execution of that. But I needed to create an overlay that allowed for cohesion as the collection grew. And that was actually really fun for me because that was a little different. I was typically initially responding to things that were put in front of me, and towards the end it was my partners who were responding to the things that myself and my team… But I always wanted to bring the best talent in. So I was hiring great designers and printmakers and copywriters. And so I had this almost like… That conductor analogy. I had this incredible group of, in this case, women assembled who had very strong points of view themselves and it created a great team.', 'Lex Fridman: So yeah, I mean, great team is really sort of essential. It’s the essential thing behind any successful story.', 'Ivanka Trump: A hundred percent.', 'Lex Fridman: But there’s this thing of taste, which is really interesting because it’s hard to articulate what it takes, but basically knowing A versus B what looks good. Or without A-B comparison to say, “If we changed this part, that would make it better.” That sort of designer taste, that’s hard to make explicit what that is, but the great designers have that taste, like, “This is going to look good.” And it’s not actually… Again, the Steve Jobs thing, it’s not the opinion poll. You can’t poll people and ask them what looks better. You have to have the vision of that. And as you said, you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your taste is good, such that you can curate, you can direct teams. You can argue that no, no, no, this is right. Even when there’s several people that say, “This doesn’t make any sense.” If you have that vision, have the confidence, this will look good. That’s how you come up with great designs. It’s a mixture of great tastes as do develop over time and the confidence.']\n"
